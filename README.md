# Student Performance Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict students' exam scores based on various features such as the number of hours studied, previous exam scores, and attendance. Regression techniques are used to build models that estimate a student's final grade given these input features. The project provides insights into factors influencing student performance and helps educators identify students who may need additional support.

## Dataset Description
The data comes from two Portuguese secondary schools, and it includes student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features. The datasets cover two distinct subjects: Mathematics (`student-mat.csv`) and Portuguese (`student-por.csv`).

32. **G2**: Second period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20)
33. **G3**: Final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20, output target)

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Load and inspect the datasets.
- Handle missing values.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Normalize/standardize numerical variables.
- Split the data into training and test sets.

### 2. Feature Selection
- Analyze the correlation between features and the target variable (G3).
- Select important features based on correlation and domain knowledge.

### 3. Model Selection and Training
- Choose regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
- Train models on the training set.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Compare the performance of different models.
